# UI Frames

Very basic tool to present captioned images in a sequence.

I imagined using it for demonstrating concepts in user interaction design.

## Demo

## Security

Not secured yet. Please use with good intent.

### Be warned:

If you are at any level concerned with your and others' being secure on the
web, - given the current development state of this project - you are advised to
refrain from using it for anything more than playing with it on your local
machine.

## Expectation management

Treat each instance of it as a disposable tool. Consider it a development snapshot. Non-backwards-compatible changes may pour in any time.

## Maintenance and support

Minimally maintained. It is a spare-time effort, and not the only one running.

Suggestions and dialogue are always preferred over out-of-the-blue pull requests.

## Planned features

* Escaping of output data (security).
* Three-column layout for screens big enough: the current header could form
  a sidebar on the left.
* Alternative layout for images (presumably in landscape orientation) up to
  1280px width.
* Tablet- and monitor-resembling visual frame around the presented images.
* Allowing setting the layout and skin variants from the document-setup file.

## Legal disclaimer

Can not take no responsibility.
