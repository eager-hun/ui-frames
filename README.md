# UI Frames

Very basic tool to present captioned images in a sequence.

I imagined using it for demonstrating user interaction design concepts.

## Demo

## Security

Not secured yet. Anyways, on this level securing it would only be symbolic. Please use with good intent.

### Be warned:

If you are at any level concerned with your and others' being secure on the
web, - given the current development state of this project - you are advised to
refrain from using it for anything more than playing with it on your local
machine.

## Expectation management

Treat each instance of it as a disposable tool. Consider it a development snapshot (nightly). Non-backwards-compatible changes may pour in any time.

## Maintenance and support

Minimally maintained. It is a spare-time effort, and not the only one running.

Suggestions and dialogue are always preferred over out-of-the-blue pull requests.

## Legal disclaimer

Can not take no responsibility.
