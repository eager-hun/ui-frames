# UI Frames

Very basic tool to present captioned images in a sequence.

I imagined using it for presenting UI design wireframes.

## Security

Not secured (yet?). Anyways, on this level securing it would only be symbolic. Please use with good intent.


## Expectation management

Don't have high expectations, it was put together in an afternoon in quite a
rushed fashion while other things had been blinking yellow on my TODO list. So
yeah.

## Maintenance and support

Minimally maintained. It is a spare-time effort, and not the only one running.

## Legal disclaimer

Can not take no responsibility.
